## Git Branch Tutorial
- Set-up new branch: `git checkout -b {branch}`
- Push changes from branch: `git push -u origin {branch}`
- Deleting a branch: `git branch -d {branch}`

- Some potentially helpful notes:
  - you can use `git branch` to check which branch you are in
  - you can use `git checkout {branch}` (notice we don't have the `-b` flag this time) to go to another branch

## MAIN TODO:
- [ ] Description of the variables and the data  
- [ ] A little background about the data (who collected it in what context)  
- [ ] What is the overall research question that you are trying to answer in your report  
- [ ] Few tables (appropriately labeled)  
- [ ] Few graphs (appropriately labeled)  
- [ ] Use of confidence interval and test of hypothesis  
- [ ] Use of bootstrapping  
- [ ] Use of regression analysis (linear or nonlinear regression [week-9] or logistic regression [week-10] or decision tree/random forest [week-11])  
- [ ] Interpretation of the regression parameters when applicable  
- [ ] Use of cross-validation  
- [ ] A final summary of your findings  
- [ ] An appendix which shows all your codes  
- [ ] 3 marks will be kept aside for the presentation of your report (e.g. proper title, subtitle, graph size, graph placing, line spacing, proper annotation of your code, etc.)  


## TODO: 
- [ ] map points using google maps and long/lat
- [ ] mutate and add a column make smaller cities "other"
- [ ] add tables 
    - Table of Mean of each city for each pollutant
    - Table of Mean of each Year for each pollutant
- [ ] do hypothesis testing
- [ ] add regression
- [ ] do cross validation testing (k-fold)
- [ ] Label All Graphs Properly
